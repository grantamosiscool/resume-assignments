                        <h1>5. Detroit Lions</h1>
                        <p class="lead"> 
                            <h2> Reasons to be excited</h2>


                             <i><h4>1) Head Coach </i> </h4> Motor City Dan Campbell is a player's coach if there ever was one and the players would clearly run through a brick wall for him. After a coaching carousel following the Jim Caldwell era, Detroit's search for a head coach is finally over, allowing them to focus solely on roster building. <br> 
                              <i><h4>2) NFC North is Down </i></h4>The Lions can certainly win their division in 2023-2024, especially if certain events take place, those events being: Aaron Rodgers leaving the Packers, the Vikings taking a step back, and the Bears fail to put the pieces together (They're still atleast a year away). <br> 
                             <i><h4>3) Quarterback</i></h4> While Jared Goff may not be the long-term-franchising-saving  QB, the Lions can certainly win their division with Goff at the helm; he is arguably the best Quarterback in that division – assuming Aaron Rodgers indeed leaves this offseason – and he had a great second half of the 2022-2023 season that helped the Lions win 9 games for the first time since 2017.<br>
                            <h2> Reasons to worry </h2> 
                            <i><h4>1) It May be too Early</i></h4> Sure, Detroit finished with a record above .500 last season, but that's the first such-season the Lions have had since 2017 when they went 9-7. Not to mention the Lions are only one season removed from winning a measly 3 games. A history of losing combined with a young roster and a relatievly inexperienced head coach brings tons of potential; but can they live up to expectations?  <br> 
                            <i><h4>2) The Lions are the Lions </i></h4>3 Playoff apperances in this CENTURY is all that really needs to be said about the Detroit Lions...the franchise has simply sucked for basically its entire existence. I try not to hold a team's past woes against them, but the Ford family's ownership of the team has been less than ideal since 1961. Detroit's football team has been in existence since 1934 and has not won or appeared in a single Super Bowl, albeit they have won a few League Championships before the Super Bowl came into existence during the 1967 season. <br> 
                            <i><h4> 3) Defense</i></h4> Detroit's defense was downright terrible for most of the first half of the 2022-2023 season, but they turned it around in the second half and played much, <i>much</i> better to close out the year. There is a lot of talent on their defense with names like Aidan Hutchinson, Malcolm Rodriguez, James Houston, C.J. Gardner-Johnson and more. While the names and the talent are there, this is the unit that Detroit and their fans should have the most concern about. We know the offense will be explosive, assuming Jared Goff can continue to improve, but it really comes down to whether or not the defense will perform.

                        <h1>4. Jacksonville Jaguars</h1>
                        <p class="lead"> 
                            <h2> Reasons to be excited</h2>
                             <i><h4>1) Quarterback</i></h4>Trevor Lawrence <i>arrived</i> during the 2022-2023 season. TLaw – from his rookie year to his sophomore season – threw 13 more touchdowns (25) and 9 less interceptions (8) while improving his completion percentage by more than 6% (66.3%). Lawrence will continue to improve his game, and pretty soon he may be talked about as one of the best QBs in the NFL. <br> 
                              <i><h4>2) Great Head Coach </i></h4>In just his first season as the head coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Super Bowl Champion Doug Pederson coached his team to a 9-8 season – their most wins since 2017 - and they even won a playoff game. Just like the Lions, the Jaguars seem to have figured out their head coach position and can now solely focus on constructing a winning roster. <br> 
                             <i><h4>3) Talent, Talent, Talent</i></h4> The Jaguars have talented players all across the board, and have roughly the 5th youngest roster in the entire NFL (about 25 years and 11 months). With players like Lawrence, Josh Allen (not the QB), Jamal Agnew, K'Lavon Chaisson, Travis Etienne Jr., Evan Engram, Zay Jones, Christian Kirk, Devin Lloyd, Calvin Ridley, etc., the Jaguars will have no shortage of help for Lawrence on the offensive side of the ball, nor should they have any problems enforcing their will on opponents on the defensive side.<br>
                            <h2> Reasons to worry </h2> 
                            <i><h4>1) AFC is LOADED</i></h4> Unfortunately for the Jacksonville Jaguars, they play in the AFC. The AFC is a more complete conference than the NFC, with better, young Quarterbacks and more explosive teams throughout the conference. While the Jaguars are going to be a very good team for years to come, they may never be able to hoist the Lombardi Trophy while the likes of Burrow, Mahomes, and Lamar Jackson are playing in the same conference.  <br> 
                            <i><h4>2) Uninspiring History </i></h4>It's hard to look at the history of the Jacksonville Jaguars and be instilled with confidence. While they have made playoff appearances in 8-of-27 seasons played, they've only won a handful of playoff games, have never reached the Super Bowl, and have only won the AFC South division four times. A lot of this has to do with ownership, both Wayne Weaver – the first owner – and Shahid Kahn – the current owner.  <br> 
                            <i><h4> 3) Relocation Talks</i></h4> Do I think the Jacksonville Jaguars will relocate? <i>Probably not.</i> But could it happen? <i>It's possible.</i> The Jaguars are known for being the only NFL team that plays a game in London every single year, and that – mixed with a history of losing in a small market like Jacksonville, Florida – have caused a lot of people to wonder if the Jaguars may relocate to London, <i>permanently</i>. Logistically, I think there are far too many moving pieces for a relocation such as this to work out, but that would need its own column. The NFL has said they want to expand the league by creating more teams (possibly 40), and if that were to happen it is certainly be posible that a team would be stationed in London full-time. As a Washington Commanders fan, I know how troublesome off-the-field-ownership issues can impact a team's on-the-filed-performance, and I hope the Jaguars can block out any noise in the building.

                        <h1>3. Philadelphia Eagles</h1>
                        <p class="lead"> 

                            <h2> Reasons to be excited</h2>
                             <i><h4>1) Quarterback </i> </h4> Starting to see a trend here? Quarterback is the most important position in sports, hands down. Which is why finding your guy is so crucial to the success and future of an organization. Jalen Hurts is on his way to being in the conversation with Mahomes, Burrow, Allen and Lamar Jackson as the best young QB's in the game year in and year out, and the slander against him needs to stop. He accounted for 35 total touchdowns this past season, threw for 3,7001 yards and ran for another 760. Hurts is an MVP caliber player and the Eagles window in the NFC is open for as long as Hurts can continue to be the best Quarterback in the conference.<br> 
                              <i><h4>2) Howie Roseman </i></h4>There are two types of NFL General Managers: <i>Aggressive and Losers.</i> Despite what <i>some</i> NFL front offices believe, it doesn't take 3-5 years to rebuild a roster. Philadelphia has been in 2 Super Bowls within 5 years with a different head coach and quarterback pairing, and that is thanks to General Manager Howie Roseman. He consistently makes aggressive trades, whether it's trading up two spots in the draft to pick Devonta SMith, or trading two picks to <i>steal</i> A.J. Brown from the Titans, and Roseman is widely considered as one of the best GMs in the entire league. We'll have to wait and see how contract manipulation will impact the Eagles cap-wise, but its hard to imagine Howie Roseman changing his aggressive nature as long as he's with the Eagles. <br> 
                             <i><h4>3) NFC is Weak</i></h4> This could, and probably will change within the next five years, but as I stated earlier the NFC is currently weaker at this point than the AFC, which is a huge plus for Philadelphia. The Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers are the cream of the crop right now in the NFC, and frankly there are no serious threats to knock off either team. I'm sure NFC teams will start adopting the aggressive mindset of AFC teams, but the Eagles are ahead of the curve. <br>
                            <h2> Reasons to worry </h2> 
                            <i><h4>1) Money</i></h4> The salary cap is real...<i>right?</i> We've seen an increasing number of teams manipulate the salary cap in recent years, the Los Angeles Rams are a perfect example. This is what you have to do in order to load a roster with talent for a shot at a 2-3 year Super Bowl window, but it can come back to bite you in the ass, see Los Angeles Rams again. Jalen Hurts will get a massive contract from Philadelphia either this year or next – as he should – but it could cause the Eagles to be strapped for cash in the near future when its time to pay guys like Devonta Smith and whoever they take with their multiple first round picks in the 2023 NFL draft.  <br> 
                            <i><h4>2) NFC Beast </i></h4>The NFC East was on the verge of making history during the 2022-2023 season by having all four teams make the playoffs, but then <b> Carson Wentz</b> happened (See Cleveland Browns vs Washington Commanders, January 1, 2023.) Philadelphia is the team to beat in the NFC East, but for whatever reason there has not been a repeat NFC East champion since the Eagles won it four times in a row from 2001-2004. Each team in the NFC East got better this offseason, so we'll have to wait and see if the curse of the NFC East champion will live to see another season. One thing is for certain though: none of the other teams in the East will be a cakewalk for the Eagles.<br> 
                            <i><h4> 3) AFC Teams</i></h4> While the Eagles are a top 1 or 2 team in the NFC, there are a few teams in the AFC that you could argue are better or atleast even with Philadelphia, and these teams could prevent Philly from reaching their ultimate goal. The obvious team is Kansas City – as the Eagles just lost to them in super Bowl LVIII – but the Bengals might also be better than the Eagles, and the Miami Dolphins seem to be ascending and loading their roster with elite talent. The question is not if Philadelphia can compete in and win the NFC, but its a question of if the Eagles can beat the Chiefs or Bengals if they meet in the Super Bowl.

                        <h1>2. Cincinnati Bengals</h1>
                        <p class="lead"> 
                            <h2> Reasons to be excited</h2>
                             <i><h4>1) Quarterback </i> </h4> <i>Suprise, Suprise.</i> The Bengals have the second brightest future in the NFL mainly because of Joe Burrow. In his rookie year Joe Burrow tore his ACL, MCL, and suffered other damage, and the Bengals only won 4 games. Once he got healthy though, <i>good grief he was good</i>. Through his first two season as the Bengals QB, Burrow has accounted for 76 total touchdowns and 26 interceptions. Not to mention he's taken the Bengals two a Super Bowl and a second AFC Championship game in back to back years. <i>Oh, and he's never lost to Patrick Mahomes.</i> Football is a team sport, obviously, but any QB of a team that has beaten a Patrick Mahomes team three times in a row has to be pretty great. As long as Cincinnatin can keep Burrow happy and healty, they could have a legit Super Bowl window of 10 years or more.   <br> 
                              <i><h4>2) Elite Wide Receiver Trio </i></h4>Ja'marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Tyler Boyd make up the best WR trio in the entire National Football League. Last season, the three receivers combined for 2,837 yards and 21 touchdowns. Although Higgins' name has been brought up in trade specualtions this offseason, the Bengals are adamant that he won't be traded. As long as the Bengals continue to surround Burrow with elite pass-catchers, they'll be in business.<br> 
                             <i><h4>3) Media Attention</i></h4> So this is less of a "football reason" to be excited, but it's important nonetheless. Before Burrow got to Cincinnati, the Bengals were just not a team that fans outside of the city were excited about or paying attention to. Winning and having one of the new faces of the league as their starting QB have given a breath of life to the Bengals franchise. With the Burrow vs Mahomes and Chiefs vs Bengals matchups dominating headlines in the AFC, expect there to be excitement and optimisim around Cincinnati for a long time.<br>
                            <h2> Reasons to worry </h2> 
                            <i><h4>1) Offensive Line</i></h4> While the Bengals offensive line was not great but not terrible last year, that isn't good enough. Not when you're going to have to pay Burrow $50M per year. Their O-line was hampered with injuries going into the playoffs and probably played a big role in the team falling short this season, but the bottom line is you need to protect an investment like Burrow. One injury to Burrow, <i>god forbid</i>, could completely derail the entire Cincinnati Bengals franchise. <br> 
                            <i><h4>2) Cheap Ownership </i></h4>Mike Brown – Owner of the Cincinnati Bengals – is notorious for being cheap . In recent years it seems like he has started dishing out more money, but the fact of the matter is there are no players on the current Bengals roster that makes more than $16M per year (Orlando Brown Jr's avg. salary is $16,023,000). While that in itself is no indictment on Brown, he must be prepared to pay Burrow and Ja'marr Chase at the least, and their average salaries will make $16M look like pocket change, especially with the rise in gauaranteed money. <br> 
                            <i><h4> 3) Conference and Divisional Gauntlet</i></h4> I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but the AFC is a loaded conference, and the Bengal's division is no walk in the park; The Ravens – assuming Lamar stays – are always a threat in the AFC North, the Browns have loads of talent on their roster and will be in every game, and the Steelers may have found their QB of the future in Kenny Pickett. <i>And that's just in the division.</i> The Bengals are still the team to beat in the north, but those teams are going to beat eachother up during the regular season and I worry about the Bengal's health once they make it to the playoffs (just like this past season).

                            <h2> Reasons to be excited</h2>
                             <i><h4>1) Patrick Mahomes </i> </h4> Do I really need to do much explaining here? Patrick Mahomes is only 27 years old and he's in a league of his own: <b>2x Super Bowl MVP, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 2x NFL MVP</b>, as well as throwing for 5,000 yards and 50 TDs in his <i>first</i> season as an NFL Quarterback. There are already talks about Mahomes being the best QB of all time when it's all said and done, and he's got a really, <i>really</i> good chance.   <br> 
                              <i><h4>2) Andy Reid</i></h4>We don't know how much longer Andy "Big Red" Reid will be coaching for, as he is 65 years old, but the end doesn't seem to be near. Reid is widely considered to be one of the best coaches of all time, as well as an offensive mastermind. Reid and Mahomes – if they maintain their current success – could go down as a pairing on the level of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. <br> 
                             <i><h4>3) Inexpensive Wide Receivers</i></h4> Qbs like Brady, Manning, Rodgers and Mahomes make everybody around them great, especially recievers. The Chiefs three starting wide recievers only make $15M per year combined, which is great for the future of Kansas City. If Mahomes can continue or improve his already elite play, the Chiefs shouldn't have tp spend much money on pass-catchers not named Travis Kelce for the forseeable future.<br>
                            <h2> Reasons to worry </h2> 
                            <i><h4>1) Cincinnati Bengals</i></h4> As great as Mahomes and the Cheifs are, they have not been able to beat the Bengals. Kansas City has proven they can beat the Buffalo Bills and every other team in the AFC – and the NFC for that matter – every team not named the Cincinnati Bengals. If the Chiefs truly want to become a dynasty, they will need to figure out how to beat the Bengals, because these are the two teams that will run the AFC for years.<br> 
                            <i><h4>2) Coaches Leaving </i></h4>Great teams have to deal with the the problem of coordinators and other coaches leaving, which can happen often and quickly. The Eagles, for example, lost their offensive and defensive coordinators just weeks after making a Super Bowl appearance. Eric Beinemy – former Kansas City Chiefs Offensive Coordinator – left KC this season to take the coordinator job for the Washington Commanders. Any Reid is a good enough coach to overcome constant staffing changes, if they were to happen, but it can create instability within an organization.  <br> 
                            <i><h4> 3) Conference and Divisional Gauntlet</i></h4> The AFC West seems to have gotten slightly worse in the past two seasons, which the exception of the Chiefs, but every single team in that division has potential to be dangerous. The Broncos should be vastly improved this upcoming season with Sean Payton as Head Coach, the Raiders should be able to turn some of those one score losses from last year into wins this season, and the Chargers are always dangerous with Justin Herbert and his offensive weapons. The Chiefs are still the best team in the entire league, but that just means they get every team's best shot.
