                            </ul> 
                            Motor City Dan Campbell is a player's coach if there ever was one and the players would clearly run through a brick wall for him. After a coaching carousel following the Jim Caldwell era, Detroit's search for a head coach is finally over, allowing them to focus solely on roster building.

                            <ul>

                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            The Lions can certainly win their division in 2023-2024, especially if certain events take place, those events being: Aaron Rodgers leaving the Packers, the Vikings taking a step back, and the Bears fail to put the pieces together (They're still at least a year away). Once this young Lions team gets a <strong>real</strong> taste of winning, they could become very dangerous.
                        </p>
                             <ul>

                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            While Jared Goff may not be the long-term-franchising-saving  QB, the Lions can certainly win their division with Goff at the helm; he is arguably the best Quarterback in that division – assuming Aaron Rodgers indeed leaves this offseason – and he had a great second half of the 2022-2023 season that helped the Lions win 9 games for the first time since 2017. If Goff can replicate his second half of the '22-'23 season, the Lions should consider sticking with him for the forseeable future.

                            Trevor Lawrence <i>arrived</i> during the 2022-2023 season. TLaw – from his rookie year to his sophomore season – threw 13 more touchdowns (25) and 9 less interceptions (8) while improving his completion percentage by more than 6% (66.3%). Lawrence will continue to improve his game, and pretty soon he may be talked about as one of the best QBs in the NFL.  
                        </p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            In just his first season as the head coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Super Bowl Champion Doug Pederson coached his team to a 9-8 season – their most wins since 2017 - and they even won a playoff game. Just like the Lions, the Jaguars seem to have figured out their head coach position and can now solely focus on constructing a winning roster. 
                        </p>
                             <ul>

                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            The Jaguars have talented players all across the board, and have roughly the 5th youngest roster in the entire NFL (about 25 years and 11 months). With players like Lawrence, Josh Allen (not the QB), Jamal Agnew, K'Lavon Chaisson, Travis Etienne Jr., Evan Engram, Zay Jones, Christian Kirk, Devin Lloyd, Calvin Ridley, etc., the Jaguars will have no shortage of help for Lawrence on the offensive side of the ball, nor should they have any problems enforcing their will on opponents on the defensive side.

                            Starting to see a trend here? Quarterback is the most important position in sports, hands down. Which is why finding your guy is so crucial to the success and future of an organization. Jalen Hurts is on his way to being in the conversation with Mahomes, Burrow, Allen and Lamar Jackson as the best young QB's in the game year in and year out, and the slander against him needs to stop. He accounted for 35 total touchdowns this past season, threw for 3,7001 yards and ran for another 760. Hurts is an MVP caliber player and the Eagles window in the NFC is open for as long as Hurts can continue to be the best Quarterback in the conference.

                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Howie Roseman</i></li>

                        <p>
                            There are two types of NFL General Managers: <i>Aggressive and Losers.</i> Despite what <i>some</i> NFL front offices believe, it doesn't take 3-5 years to rebuild a roster. Philadelphia has been in 2 Super Bowls within 5 years with a different head coach and quarterback pairing, and that is thanks to General Manager Howie Roseman. He consistently makes aggressive trades, whether it's trading up two spots in the draft to pick Devonta SMith, or trading two picks to <i>steal</i> A.J. Brown from the Titans, and Roseman is widely considered as one of the best GMs in the entire league. We'll have to wait and see how contract manipulation will impact the Eagles cap-wise, but its hard to imagine Howie Roseman changing his aggressive nature as long as he's with the Eagles. 
                        </p>
                             <ul>
                                <li><i>NFC is Weak</i></li>
                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            This could, and probably will change within the next five years, but as I stated earlier the NFC is currently weaker at this point than the AFC, which is a huge plus for Philadelphia. The Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers are the cream of the crop right now in the NFC, and frankly there are no serious threats to knock off either team. I'm sure NFC teams will start adopting the aggressive mindset of AFC teams, but the Eagles are ahead of the curve.

                            </ul> 
                            <i>Suprise, Surprise.</i> The Bengals have the second brightest future in the NFL mainly because of Joe Burrow. In his rookie year Joe Burrow tore his ACL, MCL, and suffered other damage, and the Bengals only won 4 games. Once he got healthy though, <i>good grief he was good</i>. Through his first two season as the Bengals QB, Burrow has accounted for 76 total touchdowns and 26 interceptions. Not to mention he's taken the Bengals two a Super Bowl and a second AFC Championship game in back to back years. <i>Oh, and he's 3-1 in his career vs Patrick Mahomes.</i> Football is a team sport, obviously, but any QB of a team that has beaten a Patrick Mahomes team three times in a row has to be pretty great. As long as Cincinnatin can keep Burrow happy and healthy, they could have a legit Super Bowl window of 10 years or more.
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Elite Wide Receiver Trio</i></li>
                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            Ja'marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Tyler Boyd make up the best WR trio in the entire National Football League. Last season, the three receivers combined for 2,837 yards and 21 touchdowns. Although Higgins' name has been brought up in trade speculations this offseason, the Bengals are adamant that he won't be traded. As long as the Bengals continue to surround Burrow with elite pass-catchers, they'll be in business.
                        </p>
                             <ul>
                                <li><i>Media Attention</i></li>
                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            So this is less of a "football reason" to be excited, but it's important nonetheless. Before Burrow got to Cincinnati, the Bengals were just not a team that fans outside of the city were excited about or paying attention to. Winning and having one of the new faces of the league as their starting QB have given a breath of life to the Bengals franchise. With the Burrow vs Mahomes and Chiefs vs Bengals matchups dominating headlines in the AFC, expect there to be excitement and optimism around Cincinnati for a long time.

                            </ul> 
                            Do I really need to do much explaining here? Patrick Mahomes is only 27 years old and he's in a league of his own: <b>2x Super Bowl MVP, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 2x NFL MVP</b>, as well as throwing for 5,000 yards and 50 TDs in his <i>first</i> season as an NFL Quarterback. There are already talks about Mahomes being the best QB of all time when it's all said and done, and he's got a really, <i>really</i> good chance.  
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Andy Reid</i></li>
                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            We don't know how much longer Andy "Big Red" Reid will be coaching for, as he is 65 years old, but the end doesn't seem to be near. Reid is widely considered to be one of the best coaches of all time, as well as an offensive mastermind. Reid and Mahomes – if they maintain their current success – could go down as a pairing on the level of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.

                             <ul>
                                <li><i>Inexpensive Wide Receivers</i></li>
                            </ul> 
                        <p>
                            Qbs like Brady, Manning, Rodgers and Mahomes make everybody around them great, especially receivers. The Chiefs three starting wide recievers only make $15M per year combined, which is great for the future of Kansas City. If Mahomes can continue or improve his already elite play, the Chiefs shouldn't have tp spend much money on pass-catchers not named Travis Kelce for the foreseeable future.

                        <p class="lead"><u>Washington Commanders</u></p>
                        <p>With the sale of the Washington Commanders coming up – and it will certainly happen – the Washington franchise will finally be able to focus on winning football games, rather than fixing issues of a toxic work environment filled with sexual assault and countless other scandals. Dan Snyder selling the team is like a Super Bowl to us Washington fans, but it remains to be seen how the new ownership group, whoever that may be, will implement organizational changes. With a loaded roster and playmakers on offense and defenes, the future is bright for the Washington Commanders, but it's just too early to put them in the top 5.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead"><u>Buffalo Bills</u></p>
                        <p>I'm not as high on the Bills as everybody in sports media seems to be. While they do have a top 5 quarterback in Josh Allen, <i> I just don't see Buffalo getting over the hump.</i> They have repeatedly underperformed in the playoffs, and there is little to inspire confidence that Buffalo can consistently beat Kansas City and Cincinnati in the playoffs and make it to a Super Bowl. They're loaded with talent, but have lost some defensive pieces this off-season, and with rumors of Stefon Diggs wanting a trade, their championship window could close quick.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead"><u>Miami Dolphins</u></p>
                        <p>Miami is in their talent acquisition era, as they believe they have a legitimate shot to win a Super Bowl in the very near future. Adding players like Jalen Ramsey, Tyreek Hill and Bradley Chubb are all great moves by the Dolphins, but there is still one huge question mark: Is Tua Tagovailoa really the answer at QB?<br>
                        The Dolphins are a good team when Tua plays, but he is certainly not elite, and his health seems to always be in question. This past season there were rumors that Tua might consider retiring due to all of the concussions and other neurological issues he's gotten from playing in the NFL. I just don't trust Tua to stay healthy, nor do I trust Miami to handle his injuries properly. Until Miami <i>truly</i> knows who their QB of the future is, they aren't cracking the top 5.
